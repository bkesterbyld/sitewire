        content: >
          Using an intuitive app, borrowers document job progress with video and
          photos and request funds in minutes. Background data analysis and
          location verification prevent fraud.

          Once the draw is approved, your wire department is notified or you can
          optionally do same-day payments. As the draw closes, the service
          generates analytics for go-forward budgeting and borrower risk
          scoring.
