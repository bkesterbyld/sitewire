        content: >

        content: >
          Independent, licensed GCs review the job and provides disbursement
          recommendations for your team. Then your back office approves the draw
          and Sitewire notifies your wire department. Along the way, borrowers
          can see status changes, eliminating phone calls and emails to check on
          their draws.
