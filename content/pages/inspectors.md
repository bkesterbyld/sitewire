      Sitewire is revolutionizing the residential construction lending industry
      with hybrid draw inspections. We're always adding to our network of
      independent top-drawer general contractors, whether solo or with a
      company, to help our clients accurately assess job progress. If you meet
      the following requirements, we'd love to hear from you:


      *   Experience on at least 10 residential rehab projects


      *   5 years as a licensed general contractor


      *   Bonded and prefer additional E\&O insurance (we can provide E\&O If
      you don't carry it)


      *   10 years of overall construction experience


      *   BA / BS in construction, real estate a bonus


      In exchange, we offer a steady and potentially substantial incremental
      revenue stream to your existing business and eligibility for equity
      participation in Sitewire. Additionally, you'll be exposed to a network of
      regional and national lenders and Wall Street institutions who may be able
      to benefit your business.
