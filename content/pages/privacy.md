Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the personal data ByldTech Inc. dba Sitewire (“Sitewire”) processes, how Sitewire processes it, and for what purposes. ByldTech and Sitewire offers a wide range of products for use in real estate and construction activities. References to these products in this statement include Sitewire services, websites, mobile apps, software, servers, and devices. This statement applies to the interactions Sitewire has with you and the Sitewire products listed below, as well as other Sitewire products that display this statement.



PERSONAL DATA, GENERAL STATEMENT

Sitewire collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Sitewire and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties. You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.

HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA

Sitewire uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to: • Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.

Personalize our products and make recommendations.

Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.

We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Sitewire’s iOS app combined with Sitewire’s web app) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes. Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.
